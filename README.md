# 🗄️ Python + SQL Lab Exercise 9


## 📌 Project Overview
This lab exercise demonstrates the integration of **Python and SQLite** to manage a relational database. It covers the end-to-end process of setting up a database, designing a schema, populating it with sample data, and executing complex SQL queries directly from a Jupyter Notebook.

The workflow includes:
1.  🏗️ **Database Setup**: Connecting to SQLite and creating a cursor.
2.  🛠️ **Schema Design**: creating tables for `CLIENT_MASTER`, `PRODUCT_MASTER`, `SALESMAN_MASTER`, `SALES_ORDER`, and `SALES_ORDER_DETAILS`.
3.  � **Data Insertion**: Populating tables with sample records using `executemany`.
4.  🔍 **Data Analysis**: Running SQL queries to filter, aggregate, and join data for insights.
